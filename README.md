# Cyclop

*English · [Русский](README.ru.md)*

The MacBook notch as a working tool. This fork's local build is a native
SwiftUI/AppKit panel for files, clipboard history, snippets, translation, notes,
a teleprompter and utilities. Music, Calendar and Currency are excluded from
the application build; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the local-only scope.

![The Cyclop panel](docs/panel.png)

Build this fork with `./Scripts/bundle.sh` on macOS 15 or newer. The upstream
release linked from the original project includes features that this fork omits.

## What it does

| Tab | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Shelf** | Drag files into the notch and they stay there until needed; drag a card out and the file goes wherever it is dropped. A click selects a card, ⌘-click selects several, and then the whole group is dragged. A screenshot taken to the clipboard is saved as a file and lands here too — including one taken on an iPhone, if you copy it there |
| **Clipboard** | The last 40 copies; a click puts an entry back on the clipboard |
| **Snippets** | A hand-kept list of what you are tired of retyping: an address, a phone number, an email. Added with a button in the panel, removed with the cross on a card; a click puts the text on the clipboard. The same list lives in `~/Library/Application Support/Cyclop/snippets.json` and can be edited there instead |
| **Translate** | Type on the left, the translation appears on the right — by itself, offline, using macOS's own facilities. English goes to Russian, Russian to English; the direction comes from the script the text is written in. macOS does not preinstall language packs, so the first time you have to download one: System Settings → General → Language & Region → "Translation Languages…" |
| **Teleprompter** | A script that scrolls under the camera at a speed you set. The notch is the one place on the screen a teleprompter belongs: reading happens right beside the lens, so on the recording the eyes stay on the camera instead of travelling to a window below it. The panel holds itself open while the text is moving — reading a script means not touching the trackpad |
| **Notes** | Scratch, on the right rail of icons: jot something down, come back, delete it or carry it off through the clipboard. Hovering lands with the caret ready; blank notes sweep themselves out |

The panel opens when the pointer reaches the notch and collapses when it leaves.
Tabs switch on hover as well — but only if the pointer has come to rest on the
icon: one passing through switches nothing. During a file drag the panel opens by
itself and goes straight to the shelf. The menu bar icon toggles the panel,
hides every tab's contents at once, and quits. The icon itself can be
removed — ⌘-drag it off the bar, or flip the switch in Settings — and
relaunching Cyclop brings it back.

Any included tab can be switched off in **Settings → Show in Panel**. Its icon
leaves the rail, and its background work stops with it.

## Requirements

- macOS 15 or newer (the Translate tab runs on Translation.framework)
- Swift 6 toolchain (the full Xcode is not needed, Command Line Tools are enough)

The app works on Macs without a notch too: the panel then treats a 180 × 24 pt
area at the top centre of the screen as one.

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geraskinalekseysergeevich/cyclop.git
cd cyclop
./Scripts/bundle.sh          # swift build + assemble the .app + ad-hoc sign
open build/Cyclop.app
```

The icon is generated in code, with no graphics editor involved:

```bash
swift Scripts/make-icon.swift "$PWD/Resources/AppIcon.icns"
```

## Installation

The local build is ad-hoc signed and not notarised. Gatekeeper may require
**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** on another Mac. For
corporate distribution, set `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` to your organization's
Developer ID certificate; notarization is a separate step.

To package a DMG locally:

```bash
./Scripts/dmg.sh
```

The original project's release builds include Music, Calendar and Currency,
which this fork removes. Use an app built from this checkout.

## Permissions

**Nothing at launch, and nothing until you press the button that needs it.**
The local build has no Apple Events or Calendar entitlement.

**Accessibility**, for the keyboard lock in Utilities. It deserves to be named
plainly: it lets an app see and swallow system key
presses while the keyboard lock is active. It is requested only after the user
presses the lock button.

If keyboard lock is not used, the app does not request Accessibility. Nothing
is asked for at launch. The pointer position is read through
`NSEvent.mouseLocation`, and the clipboard through the public `NSPasteboard`.

A file put on the shelf from Downloads, Documents or the Desktop is the one thing
macOS asks about separately, and it asks when the shelf is opened, not at launch.
Refusing breaks nothing: the card stays, just without a preview.

## How it works

Why the window is shaped the way it is, why the pointer is polled on a
timer, and what sitting idle costs — see the architecture notes:
**[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)**.

## Limitations

- The shelf references files rather than copying them: move the original and the
  card disappears on the next launch. The exception is clipboard screenshots,
  which are saved into `~/Pictures/Cyclop` and are never deleted automatically,
  even when the card leaves the shelf. Only the user clears that folder: the
  “Clear Screenshots Folder” in Settings sends its contents to the Trash —
  a hand too, not a schedule.
- Entries typed `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType` (password managers) never enter
  the clipboard history.
- A screenshot from the iPhone arrives through Universal Clipboard, so it needs
  what that needs: one Apple ID, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on, Handoff enabled and the
  devices near each other. And it overwrites the clipboard on the Mac — what was
  overwritten stays in the Clipboard tab one click away.
- macOS does not preinstall translation languages — the first time, the pack has
  to be downloaded through System Settings; the panel says so and opens the right
  screen.

The excluded feature source files remain in the checkout, but are not compiled
into this app target.

## Contributing

The rules are short and live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). This build
makes no app-initiated network requests and asks for no permission at launch.

What the app reads, what it keeps and where, where it goes on the network —
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). The channel for vulnerabilities is there too:
private, no issue needed.

## Thanks

The app is free — no subscriptions, no ads, no data collection — and will stay
that way. If it turned out useful and you feel like supporting it:
